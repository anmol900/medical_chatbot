Allergies occur when the body's immune mechanism recognises some substances as harmful and creates Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to combat them. The intensity of an allergy differs from one person to the other.
Fruit allergies account for roughly 10% of all food allergies and cause the body to perceive the fruit as a toxic substance rather than a food. The immune mechanism releases antibodies and histamines to combat the toxin, resulting in symptoms such as oedema, rashes, gastrointestinal difficulties, throat swelling, and more. These allergic responses may affect the mouth or any skin surface that comes into contact with the allergen.

This HIV DUO test helps detect HIV 1 and 2 antibodies and P24 antigen. The antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 are usually not detectable until 6 to 12 weeks following exposure and are mostly detectable within 12 months. The P24 antigen is an indicator of HIV infection which can be detected earlier than tests that only look for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) antibodies. HIV weakens a person’s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. The main modes of HIV transmission include unprotected sex with a person who has HIV (anal or vaginal), sharing needles, syringes, from mother-to-baby during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding, receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants from infected person. The test is advised for people with symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, oral thrush, sore throat, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, and mouth ulcers. The person may be asymptomatic during the acute phase of infection.

Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) is produced in the reproductive tissues of both females and males. The hormone plays a crucial role in the development of sex organs in an unborn baby. At a later stage, these hormones assume different roles to be played at puberty.
An AMH is firstly made in primary follicles that are difficult to observe using microscopic analysis. It is possible to opt for an AMH test any day of the cycle because it remains constant in women’s blood. That is because as follicles grow, the production of this hormone decreases and eventually stops.

The Apollo PCOD Basic Panel is as a crucial diagnostic tool curated to diagnose Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD), its causes and its associated health problems. PCOD stems from imbalances in hormones, particularly elevated androgens, disrupting the menstrual cycle and leading to cysts in the ovaries. This PCOD panel test analyses key hormonal markers, aiding in the identification of the hormonal disorder. PCOD is influenced by factors such as insulin resistance, genetic predisposition, and hormonal irregularities. Some common symptoms of PCOD include: Irregular menstrual cycles: Women with PCOD may experience infrequent or absent periods, disrupting the typical monthly cycle. This irregularity is often a result of hormonal imbalances, specifically elevated androgens, impacting the normal ovulation process. Excessive hair growth: Increased facial or body hair, a condition known as hirsutism, may be observed in individuals with PCOD. This occurs due to elevated levels of androgens, such as testosterone, which stimulate the growth of coarse and dark hair in areas more typical of male hair patterns. Acne: PCOD can cause persistent acne or oily skin. Hormonal fluctuations, particularly increased androgens, contribute to overactive sebaceous glands, leading to the development of acne and excessively oily skin. Weight gain: Many women with PCOS find it challenging to manage their weight due to metabolic disturbances associated with insulin resistance. The body may struggle to process insulin efficiently, leading to increased fat storage and difficulties in weight management. Hair loss: Thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp, known as male pattern baldness or androgenic alopecia, may be a result of PCOD. Hormonal imbalances, specifically elevated androgens, can affect hair follicles, leading to hair thinning or loss. Mood swings: Hormonal imbalances associated with PCOD can lead to emotional changes and mood swings. Fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone levels may impact neurotransmitters in the brain, influencing mood regulation and contributing to mood swings, irritability, or feelings of anxiety or depression. The Apollo PCOD profile blood test requires a blood sample for analysis. A qualified healthcare professional will collect a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm using a sterile needle. The procedure is quick and relatively painless. The PCOD panel test consists of the following tests: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Serum: This test measures the levels of TSH in the blood to evaluate thyroid function. Luteinizing Hormone (LH): LH levels are assessed to determine the hormonal imbalances often seen in PCOD. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): FSH levels are measured to evaluate the functioning of the ovaries. Insulin (Fasting): This test determines insulin levels as insulin resistance is a common characteristic of PCOD. Prolactin: Prolactin levels are evaluated to rule out other hormonal disorders that may mimic PCOD symptoms. Glucose, Fasting: Fasting glucose levels are measured to assess the risk of developing diabetes, which is higher in women with PCOD. Testosterone, Total: Total testosterone levels are analysed to identify any hormonal imbalances related to PCOD. In case of a positive diagnosis, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and personalised treatment options. Treatment for PCOD typically focuses on managing symptoms, reducing the risk of complications, and improving fertility if desired. Lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise, along with medication, may be recommended to regulate menstrual cycles, reduce excessive hair growth, and manage insulin resistance.

The Apollo PCOD Comprehensive Panel is crucial for people dealing with Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD) or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOD is a common hormonal disorder associated with the formation of small cysts in the ovaries. The PCOD blood test assesses some important hormones and metabolic factors related to the disorder. Factors contributing to the development of PCOD include insulin resistance, elevated levels of androgens, and genetic predispositions. By offering a comprehensive analysis of these factors, this PCOD test at home plays a pivotal role in facilitating an accurate diagnosis for individuals grappling with PCOD. Some symptoms associated with PCOD are listed below: Irregular or absent menstrual periods: Menstrual cycles that don't follow a regular pattern or are completely absent Excessive hair growth on the face, chest, or back (hirsutism): Unwanted and increased hair growth in areas typically seen in males, such as the face, chest, or back Acne or oily skin: Skin-related symptoms like persistent acne or excessively oily skin Weight gain or difficulty losing weight: Unexplained weight gain or challenges in losing weight, often tied to insulin resistance and metabolic disturbances associated with PCOD Thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp (male pattern baldness): Hair-related symptoms such as thinning hair or a pattern of hair loss resembling male baldness Darkening of the skin: Particularly in skin folds such as the neck, groin, and under the breasts Mood swings or depression: Emotional symptoms such as mood swings or persistent feelings of sadness, potentially linked to hormonal imbalances affecting mood-regulating pathways in PCOD The PCOD blood test requires a blood sample for testing. For this, fasting for 10-12 hours is required to obtain accurate results. A trained phlebotomist ensures a hassle-free experience by collecting the blood sample for the PCOD test at home. Using a sterile needle and syringe, the procedure is quick, relatively painless, and conducted with precision in the comfort of your own space. Once the blood sample is collected, it will be sent to the laboratory for analysis. The sample will undergo various tests including: 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP): To assess adrenal gland function Luteinizing Hormone (LH): Essential for assessing ovulation and normal menstrual cycles Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): Crucial for analyzing reproductive function Prolactin: To assess prolactin, responsible for milk production and fertility Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate - (DHEAS): To assess adrenal gland function Thyroid Profile (Total T3, Total T4, TSH): To evaluate overall thyroid functioning and health Lipid Profile: To assess the risk of cardiovascular diseases Anti Mullerian Hormone (AMH): To assess ovarian reserve and indicate fertility potential Testosterone, Total: To measure hormone levels, often elevated in PCOD Homa IR: To evaluate insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell function In case of a positive diagnosis of PCOD, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and personalised treatment plans. Treatment options may include lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, hormonal therapy, and management of associated symptoms. Early diagnosis and intervention can help prevent complications associated with PCOD.

What is an NT - Pro BNP (N-Terminal Pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide)?
The N-terminal Pro brain natriuretic peptide is a protein produced by the heart and released into your bloodstream when there's increased tension in your heart's walls. This protein turns into a hormone known as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring heart failure. The NT Pro BNP test measures the levels of NT-pro BNP in your blood, which increase when the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreases. This indicates that the heart is working harder than usual and struggling to pump blood effectively. Doctors often use the NT Pro BNP Lab Test report to differentiate between patients with normal and reduced LVEF.

Ceruloplasmin is a protein in the human body responsible for storing and carrying mineral copper around the body. Usually, the liver transfers the liver from the bloodstream to the ceruloplasmin, which helps transport it to the other tissues. Copper is vital for the body, helping promote strong bones and producing melanin. However, too much copper in the blood can be toxic and lead to health complications.
The presence of excessive copper in the body may lead to a condition called Wilson's disease. It leads to the build-up of copper around the liver, brain, and other vital organs. The disorder can be credited to copper toxicity, where the body cannot eliminate it effectively.

The Apollo PCOD Basic Panel is as a crucial diagnostic tool curated to diagnose Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD), its causes and its associated health problems. PCOD stems from imbalances in hormones, particularly elevated androgens, disrupting the menstrual cycle and leading to cysts in the ovaries. This PCOD panel test analyses key hormonal markers, aiding in the identification of the hormonal disorder. PCOD is influenced by factors such as insulin resistance, genetic predisposition, and hormonal irregularities. Some common symptoms of PCOD include: Irregular menstrual cycles: Women with PCOD may experience infrequent or absent periods, disrupting the typical monthly cycle. This irregularity is often a result of hormonal imbalances, specifically elevated androgens, impacting the normal ovulation process. Excessive hair growth: Increased facial or body hair, a condition known as hirsutism, may be observed in individuals with PCOD. This occurs due to elevated levels of androgens, such as testosterone, which stimulate the growth of coarse and dark hair in areas more typical of male hair patterns. Acne: PCOD can cause persistent acne or oily skin. Hormonal fluctuations, particularly increased androgens, contribute to overactive sebaceous glands, leading to the development of acne and excessively oily skin. Weight gain: Many women with PCOS find it challenging to manage their weight due to metabolic disturbances associated with insulin resistance. The body may struggle to process insulin efficiently, leading to increased fat storage and difficulties in weight management. Hair loss: Thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp, known as male pattern baldness or androgenic alopecia, may be a result of PCOD. Hormonal imbalances, specifically elevated androgens, can affect hair follicles, leading to hair thinning or loss. Mood swings: Hormonal imbalances associated with PCOD can lead to emotional changes and mood swings. Fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone levels may impact neurotransmitters in the brain, influencing mood regulation and contributing to mood swings, irritability, or feelings of anxiety or depression. The Apollo PCOD profile blood test requires a blood sample for analysis. A qualified healthcare professional will collect a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm using a sterile needle. The procedure is quick and relatively painless. The PCOD panel test consists of the following tests: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Serum: This test measures the levels of TSH in the blood to evaluate thyroid function. Luteinizing Hormone (LH): LH levels are assessed to determine the hormonal imbalances often seen in PCOD. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): FSH levels are measured to evaluate the functioning of the ovaries. Insulin (Fasting): This test determines insulin levels as insulin resistance is a common characteristic of PCOD. Prolactin: Prolactin levels are evaluated to rule out other hormonal disorders that may mimic PCOD symptoms. Glucose, Fasting: Fasting glucose levels are measured to assess the risk of developing diabetes, which is higher in women with PCOD. Testosterone, Total: Total testosterone levels are analysed to identify any hormonal imbalances related to PCOD. In case of a positive diagnosis, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and personalised treatment options. Treatment for PCOD typically focuses on managing symptoms, reducing the risk of complications, and improving fertility if desired. Lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise, along with medication, may be recommended to regulate menstrual cycles, reduce excessive hair growth, and manage insulin resistance.

Glucose Fasting & PP Panel is a comprehensive test that measures the levels of glucose in the blood both before and after a meal. The test helps in diagnosing and monitoring various conditions related to glucose metabolism. At Apollo 24|7, we offer this test to provide accurate and timely results for individuals of all age groups. The Glucose Fasting & PP Panel is primarily used for the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a chronic condition characterised by elevated blood glucose levels due to either insufficient insulin production or impaired insulin action. This test helps in assessing fasting glucose levels and postprandial glucose levels, which are crucial in determining the overall glucose control in individuals. Some of the common symptoms that may indicate the need for a Glucose Fasting & PP Test, include: Frequent urination Excessive thirst Unexplained weight loss Fatigue Blurred vision Slow healing of wounds Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet To perform the Glucose Fasting & PP Panel, a sample of blood is collected from the patient using a sodium fluoride plasma tube. The patient needs to be fasting for a minimum of 8 hours prior to the test to ensure accurate results. The sodium fluoride additive helps preserve the glucose levels in the sample without any changes during transportation to the laboratory. The patient arrives at the designated collection centre after fasting for a minimum of 10-12 hours. A healthcare professional collects a sample of blood using a sodium fluoride plasma tube. The sample is then transported to the laboratory for analysis. In the laboratory, the glucose levels in both fasting and postprandial samples are measured using advanced diagnostic techniques. The test results are generated and made available within a short turnaround time. If an individual receives a positive diagnosis for diabetes based on the Glucose Fasting & PP Panel, various treatment options are available. These may include lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management. Additionally, medication, insulin therapy, and regular monitoring of blood glucose levels may also be recommended by healthcare professionals to manage the condition effectively. If you're looking for a convenient and reliable way to get a Glucose Fasting & PP Panel done, booking an appointment at Apollo 24|7 is a great choice. Here are the benefits of getting an early test done at Apollo 24|7: 1. Accurate Assessment: The Glucose Fasting & PP Panel provides precise measurements of fasting and postprandial glucose levels, enabling accurate diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes. 2. Timely Intervention: Early detection allows for timely intervention, enabling individuals to make necessary lifestyle changes or start appropriate medication to control their blood glucose levels. 3. Prevent Complications: Early diagnosis and effective management of diabetes can help prevent complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems.

The Heart Panel (Sugar and Heart) is a comprehensive sugar test panel designed to assess your risk of diabetes and heart disease by measuring various markers related to blood sugar levels and lipid profile. This panel includes three important tests - glucose random, HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin), and lipid profile. These tests provide valuable insights into your diabetes status and overall cardiovascular health. The Heart Panel (Sugar and Heart) is a sugar package that helps in the early detection, prevention, and management of heart-related conditions. Some of the common symptoms that may indicate the need for a comprehensive panel of tests, such as the Heart Panel (Sugar and Heart), include the following: Frequent urination Increased thirst Fatigue or tiredness Unexplained weight loss or gain Blurred vision Numbness or tingling in hands or feet Slow-healing wounds Chest pain or discomfort Shortness of breath The Heart Panel (Sugar and Heart) requires a blood sample for analysis. A qualified healthcare professional will collect a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm using a vacutainer. This quick and simple procedure typically takes only a few minutes to complete. The procedure is relatively painless when performed by experts at Apollo 24|7. The collected blood sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. The Heart Panel (Sugar and Heart) includes several tests such as: 1. Glucose Random: The sugar test measures the blood sugar level at any time of the day, regardless of when you last ate. It helps evaluate how well your body is managing glucose levels. 2. HbA1c (Glycated Haemoglobin): The sugar package provides an average measure of your blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months. It is used to assess long-term blood sugar levels and monitor the effectiveness of diabetes management. 3. Lipid Profile: The heart test measures various types of lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) in your blood. It helps assess your risk for developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. The sugar test and heart test have their specific procedures, which are performed by trained medical professionals in the Apollo 24|7 laboratories. In case of a positive result indicating abnormal blood sugar levels or lipid profile, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional who may recommend further diagnostic tests or provide appropriate guidance and treatment options. Treatment may include lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes, regular exercise, and medications if necessary. Early detection and management of these conditions can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. The benefits of early testing and diagnosis include: 1. Accurate Assessment: Heart Panel (Sugar and Heart) provides accurate and reliable results, allowing healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding treatment and management plans. 2. Early Intervention: Detecting abnormalities in blood sugar levels and lipids profiles early on allows for timely intervention, preventing the progression of heart-related conditions and diseases. 3. Prevention: By identifying potential risk factors, you can take the necessary steps to modify your lifestyle, reducing the risk of heart disease development.

The Apollo PCOD Basic Panel is as a crucial diagnostic tool curated to diagnose Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD), its causes and its associated health problems. PCOD stems from imbalances in hormones, particularly elevated androgens, disrupting the menstrual cycle and leading to cysts in the ovaries. This PCOD panel test analyses key hormonal markers, aiding in the identification of the hormonal disorder. PCOD is influenced by factors such as insulin resistance, genetic predisposition, and hormonal irregularities. Some common symptoms of PCOD include: Irregular menstrual cycles: Women with PCOD may experience infrequent or absent periods, disrupting the typical monthly cycle. This irregularity is often a result of hormonal imbalances, specifically elevated androgens, impacting the normal ovulation process. Excessive hair growth: Increased facial or body hair, a condition known as hirsutism, may be observed in individuals with PCOD. This occurs due to elevated levels of androgens, such as testosterone, which stimulate the growth of coarse and dark hair in areas more typical of male hair patterns. Acne: PCOD can cause persistent acne or oily skin. Hormonal fluctuations, particularly increased androgens, contribute to overactive sebaceous glands, leading to the development of acne and excessively oily skin. Weight gain: Many women with PCOS find it challenging to manage their weight due to metabolic disturbances associated with insulin resistance. The body may struggle to process insulin efficiently, leading to increased fat storage and difficulties in weight management. Hair loss: Thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp, known as male pattern baldness or androgenic alopecia, may be a result of PCOD. Hormonal imbalances, specifically elevated androgens, can affect hair follicles, leading to hair thinning or loss. Mood swings: Hormonal imbalances associated with PCOD can lead to emotional changes and mood swings. Fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone levels may impact neurotransmitters in the brain, influencing mood regulation and contributing to mood swings, irritability, or feelings of anxiety or depression. The Apollo PCOD profile blood test requires a blood sample for analysis. A qualified healthcare professional will collect a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm using a sterile needle. The procedure is quick and relatively painless. The PCOD panel test consists of the following tests: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Serum: This test measures the levels of TSH in the blood to evaluate thyroid function. Luteinizing Hormone (LH): LH levels are assessed to determine the hormonal imbalances often seen in PCOD. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): FSH levels are measured to evaluate the functioning of the ovaries. Insulin (Fasting): This test determines insulin levels as insulin resistance is a common characteristic of PCOD. Prolactin: Prolactin levels are evaluated to rule out other hormonal disorders that may mimic PCOD symptoms. Glucose, Fasting: Fasting glucose levels are measured to assess the risk of developing diabetes, which is higher in women with PCOD. Testosterone, Total: Total testosterone levels are analysed to identify any hormonal imbalances related to PCOD. In case of a positive diagnosis, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and personalised treatment options. Treatment for PCOD typically focuses on managing symptoms, reducing the risk of complications, and improving fertility if desired. Lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise, along with medication, may be recommended to regulate menstrual cycles, reduce excessive hair growth, and manage insulin resistance.

A Vitamin B12 and Folate test is a blood test that measures the levels of two important B vitamins, vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and folate (also known as folic acid or vitamin B9), in one's bloodstream. These vitamins play crucial roles in various bodily functions, and testing their levels can help diagnose deficiencies or assess overall health.

A Vitamin B12 and Folate test is typically recommended for individuals in several specific situations. Firstly, if someone experiences symptoms associated with a deficiency in these vitamins, such as restlessness or neurological issues, their doctor may order these tests to assess their vitamin levels. Secondly, certain populations, including older adults, vegetarians/vegans, individuals with malabsorption conditions, and pregnant women, are at a higher risk of developing deficiencies and may undergo these tests as part of routine health assessments. Additionally, people with chronic medical conditions that can affect nutrient absorption may be monitored regularly for vitamin B12 and folate levels.

Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency typically encompass fatigue, weakness, and neurological issues like numbness or tingling in the extremities, difficulty with balance and walking, and cognitive changes such as memory problems or mood disturbances. Physical signs may include glossitis and jaundice. On the other hand, folate deficiency often shows symptoms like tiredness, anaemia, mouth sores, digestive problems, and mental changes like difficulty concentrating and mood disturbances. During pregnancy, folate deficiency can harm fetal development. As these symptoms can overlap with other conditions, it's essential to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis.

To collect a blood sample for the test, a trained laboratory technician from Apollo 24|7 will come to your doorstep to draw blood from a vein in your arm by inserting a needle. The procedure is quick, simple, and relatively painless when performed by experts at Apollo 24|7.
The Apollo Vitamin B12 and Folate test consists of two tests which include the Vitamin B12 test and the Folic Acid - Serum test. Each test has its specific procedure, which is performed by trained medical professionals in the Apollo 24|7 labs.

If the test shows a deficiency in vitamin B12, one should consult a doctor who shall work to determine the cause. Treatment often involves vitamin B12 supplementation, either in the form of oral supplements or injections, depending on the severity of the deficiency. On the other hand, for folate deficiency, treatment usually involves increasing dietary folate intake and sometimes taking folic acid supplements. Adequate folate levels are especially important during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus. If these deficiencies are caused by malabsorption or an underlying medical condition, those issues also need to be addressed.

To opt for an Apollo Vitamin B12 and Folate test on Apollo 24|7, individuals can book a slot through the website or mobile app. The Apollo Vitamin B12 and Folate test price is competitive with market standards, and the test results are usually available within 24 hours of sample collection.

The Apollo PCOD Comprehensive Panel is crucial for people dealing with Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD) or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOD is a common hormonal disorder associated with the formation of small cysts in the ovaries. The PCOD blood test assesses some important hormones and metabolic factors related to the disorder. Factors contributing to the development of PCOD include insulin resistance, elevated levels of androgens, and genetic predispositions. By offering a comprehensive analysis of these factors, this PCOD test at home plays a pivotal role in facilitating an accurate diagnosis for individuals grappling with PCOD. Some symptoms associated with PCOD are listed below: Irregular or absent menstrual periods: Menstrual cycles that don't follow a regular pattern or are completely absent Excessive hair growth on the face, chest, or back (hirsutism): Unwanted and increased hair growth in areas typically seen in males, such as the face, chest, or back Acne or oily skin: Skin-related symptoms like persistent acne or excessively oily skin Weight gain or difficulty losing weight: Unexplained weight gain or challenges in losing weight, often tied to insulin resistance and metabolic disturbances associated with PCOD Thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp (male pattern baldness): Hair-related symptoms such as thinning hair or a pattern of hair loss resembling male baldness Darkening of the skin: Particularly in skin folds such as the neck, groin, and under the breasts Mood swings or depression: Emotional symptoms such as mood swings or persistent feelings of sadness, potentially linked to hormonal imbalances affecting mood-regulating pathways in PCOD The PCOD blood test requires a blood sample for testing. For this, fasting for 10-12 hours is required to obtain accurate results. A trained phlebotomist ensures a hassle-free experience by collecting the blood sample for the PCOD test at home. Using a sterile needle and syringe, the procedure is quick, relatively painless, and conducted with precision in the comfort of your own space. Once the blood sample is collected, it will be sent to the laboratory for analysis. The sample will undergo various tests including: 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP): To assess adrenal gland function Luteinizing Hormone (LH): Essential for assessing ovulation and normal menstrual cycles Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): Crucial for analyzing reproductive function Prolactin: To assess prolactin, responsible for milk production and fertility Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate - (DHEAS): To assess adrenal gland function Thyroid Profile (Total T3, Total T4, TSH): To evaluate overall thyroid functioning and health Lipid Profile: To assess the risk of cardiovascular diseases Anti Mullerian Hormone (AMH): To assess ovarian reserve and indicate fertility potential Testosterone, Total: To measure hormone levels, often elevated in PCOD Homa IR: To evaluate insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell function In case of a positive diagnosis of PCOD, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and personalised treatment plans. Treatment options may include lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, hormonal therapy, and management of associated symptoms. Early diagnosis and intervention can help prevent complications associated with PCOD.

If you suffer from high cholesterol levels, you have probably been asked by your doctor or healthcare provider to lower your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. LDL cholesterol is often called “bad” cholesterol since it blocks the blood vessels and increases the chances of having a heart attack or stroke.
To understand the contributors of heart attacks, many doctors prescribe the C-reactive protein test.
C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. Its level rises due to inflammation in the body. The C-reactive protein test measures the levels of C-reactive protein in the blood.

Chickenpox is a common childhood disease that is highly contagious and may cause red, itchy sores throughout the body. Chickenpox is usually a mild illness in healthy children, but it can become serious for people with a weakened immune system, pregnant women, adults, and new born babies. Shingles may cause a painful, burning rash that may be localized in one part of the body, or it can spread to other parts.

The Filaria Antigen test is a diagnostic test used to detect the presence of microfilariae infections in individuals. Microfilariae are filarial larvae, thread-like worms found in infected mosquitoes. When infected mosquitoes bite a human they transmit these thread-like worms into the blood causing a parasitic disease called Filariasis. The microfilariae also disrupt the lymphatic system's function thereby causing lymphatic filariasis. The Filaria Antigen test enables healthcare professionals to identify specific antigens produced by filarial worms, allowing for early detection and appropriate treatment of these conditions.

The microfilariae circulate in the body during the night, which is why a blood sample should be taken at that time. This test detects higher anti-filarial antibodies in the blood.

In severe cases, the symptoms of the infection are grossly swollen limbs, pitting of the skin, and swelling in the genitals. Filariasis, if left untreated, can develop into chyluria, hydrocele, lymphedema, and elephantiasis.

Pseudocholinesterase: You can find them in serum, liver, muscle, pancreas, the white matter of the brain, and the heart.
The enzyme plays a vital role in transmitting the nerve impulse by breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. A reduction in the activity of the cholinesterase leads to an excess of acetylcholine in the nerve ending, leading to overstimulation of nerves within the body.

The alpha-1 antitrypsin test may also help diagnose a rare form of liver disease occurring in infants.
Usually, the deficiency of AAT can be genetic since this protein is made by specific genes in the patient’s body. Every individual inherits two copies of genes that make the AAT protein from each of their parents. If these genes undergo mutation, the body may produce less alpha-1 antitrypsin protein than it normally should, or the protein will not work as intended.

Among all the functions the liver performs, excreting bile is the most crucial function of the liver.
Bile is a digestive fluid that aids in the removal of waste and the breakdown of lipids in the small intestine during digestion. The sticky fluid contains bile salts, electrolytes, bile pigments, cholesterol, and other fats. Besides digestion, bile acid helps in the management of cholesterol levels.

Ceruloplasmin is a protein in the human body responsible for storing and carrying mineral copper around the body. Usually, the liver transfers the liver from the bloodstream to the ceruloplasmin, which helps transport it to the other tissues. Copper is vital for the body, helping promote strong bones and producing melanin. However, too much copper in the blood can be toxic and lead to health complications.
The presence of excessive copper in the body may lead to a condition called Wilson's disease. It leads to the build-up of copper around the liver, brain, and other vital organs. The disorder can be credited to copper toxicity, where the body cannot eliminate it effectively.

A Renal Profile or Kidney Function Test (RFT/KFT) is a group of diagnostic assessments that are used to determine the health of the kidneys by evaluating various parameters such as proteins, electrolytes, and minerals. Kidneys not only flush out waste and toxins from our body through urine but also aid in the production of vitamin D, red blood cells and blood pressure-regulating hormones. Therefore, keeping your kidneys healthy should be a primary aim and this is where a Kft test comes in handy.

Serum creatinine test is a vital test that determines how well your kidneys are working. Creatinine is the waste product produced through the breakdown of muscle and protein. It is the function of the kidneys to filter it out from blood and excrete it out through urine. 
A Creatinine blood test is done to ascertain the renal function. If the kidneys’ ability to filter out the creatinine is affected, then its levels rise in the blood. The accumulation of this waste chemical in the blood can lead to swelling of the body, especially face and feet, vomitings and decreased urine output. Low levels of serum creatinine indicate low muscle mass. A Creatinine blood test will help the doctor to take measures to improve your kidneys’ health.

Even when you are resting, your body is constantly working, and producing energy for the proper working of all parts of the body. Typically, the food we eat is used for this energy production, and the unused or undigested parts are ‘excreted’ out of the body via urine and stool.   Uric acid is the final waste product of purine (a type of protein) metabolism; it is the function of the kidneys to filter it out. A uric acid serum test reflects the uric acid content in your blood. As a result, any deviation from the uric acid normal range can be an indication of various medical conditions like dehydration, kidney disease, heart disease, cancer, etc.

A blood urea and serum creatinine test comprises two different tests to check the function of the kidneys. These two substances, urea and creatinine, are waste products produced as a result of the body's metabolism. Typically, urea and creatinine dissolve in the blood and your kidneys filter them and excrete them out through urine. However, in kidney disease, the levels of both these by-products will increase in the blood, as the kidneys will be unable to filter them. 
Abnormal urea and creatinine levels in the blood are a sign of acute or chronic kidney disease. Your doctor will advise further tests to evaluate for the cause of this and the kind of kidney disease you might be having.

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is the primary hormone of your pituitary gland that regulates the function of your thyroid gland. Physicians depend on the serum TSH test because it keeps the production of all the other hormones in check. Also, the TSH hormone acts as the signalling molecule that guides your thyroid gland to release other thyroid hormones in the blood. Hence, the serum TSH test is an essential parameter for understanding the functioning of the thyroid gland.

An AMH is firstly made in primary follicles that are difficult to observe using microscopic analysis. It is possible to opt for an AMH test any day of the cycle because it remains constant in women’s blood. That is because as follicles grow, the production of this hormone decreases and eventually stops.

Unconjugated Estradiol (UE3) is a routine second-trimester laboratory test used to measure the levels of unconjugated estriol in the blood of pregnant women. Congenital abnormalities and chromosomal variations in newborns are diagnosed by testing the estriol levels.

Estriol is produced by the placenta (a protective covering for the foetus) from maternal substrates (cholesterol and pregnenolone). Estriol diffuses from the placenta into the maternal blood, where it can be measured as unconjugated uE3. In normal pregnancies, uE3 levels increase from about 4 nmol/L at 15 weeks gestation to about 40 nmol/L at delivery. The test is mainly used to diagnose Down syndrome when the levels are lower than the standard threshold, which is 14.60 ng/ml in pregnant women. An abnormally low UE3 level can also indicate the possibility of aromatase deficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, primary or secondary (including maternal corticosteroid therapy) foetal adrenal insufficiency and/or foetal demise.

The Apollo 24|7 Inhibin B test is a type of blood test that checks a hormone called Inhibin B. Inhibin B levels are typically measured in picograms per millilitre (pg/mL). In women, the normal range is around 45-200 pg/mL, and in men, it is typically 80-250 pg/mL.

The Inhibin test is recommended for individuals with reproductive health concerns. In women, it's valuable for those trying to conceive, facing fertility issues, having irregular menstrual cycles, or having a history of conditions like Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The Inhibin B test is also useful for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies like In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). In men, it is beneficial when there are signs of testicular dysfunction or infertility. This test helps healthcare providers analyse reproductive health and make informed decisions about fertility treatments.

By measuring Inhibin B levels via the Apollo 24/7 Inhibin test, doctors can know the function of reproductive organs and make informed decisions about fertility treatments or the diagnosis of reproductive health conditions.

The Apollo 24|7 Inhibin B test is a simple and relatively quick process that involves blood collection, that can provide important information about one's reproductive health. To collect a blood sample for the test, a laboratory technician draws blood from a vein in one's arm by inserting a needle. The procedure is quick, simple, and relatively painless when performed by experts at Apollo 24|7.

The Apollo 24|7 Inhibin Test results reflect the Inhibin B levels in the blood. For women, it helps in clarifying the concerns related to fertility and assessing the proper functioning of the ovaries. In men, it helps to see if their reproductive organs are working well, and low levels could mean there are problems. This method is used to find issues with one's ability to have babies and to decide what kind of treatment one might need.

When the electrolytes are in order, the body has enough fluids, and all the muscles and nerves function properly. So, if the aldosterone levels are abnormal, it can hamper your body's functioning. 
Usually, doctors also prescribe the renin test along with the aldosterone test. Renin is a hormone secreted by the kidneys which signals the adrenal glands to produce aldosterone.

A Renal Profile or Kidney Function Test (RFT/KFT) is a group of diagnostic assessments that are used to determine the health of the kidneys by evaluating various parameters such as proteins, electrolytes, and minerals. Kidneys not only flush out waste and toxins from our body through urine but also aid in the production of vitamin D, red blood cells and blood pressure-regulating hormones. Therefore, keeping your kidneys healthy should be a primary aim and this is where a Kft test comes in handy.

A Glucose Fasting test determines the quantity of glucose, or sugar, in your bloodstream. Your body turns the carbohydrates you consume into glucose, which you can use for energy. Blood glucose levels that are very high or low may indicate a significant medical problem, such as diabetes.  
Doctors frequently request a blood glucose test to help identify diabetes. Gestational diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes are the main conditions that are diagnosed or treated by glucose testing. Chronically high blood sugar levels can cause heart disease, renal damage, blindness, and other catastrophic diseases if left untreated. Therefore, it is important to maintain normal fasting blood sugar levels.

Serum creatinine test is a vital test that determines how well your kidneys are working. Creatinine is the waste product produced through the breakdown of muscle and protein. It is the function of the kidneys to filter it out from blood and excrete it out through urine. 
A Creatinine blood test is done to ascertain the renal function. If the kidneys’ ability to filter out the creatinine is affected, then its levels rise in the blood. The accumulation of this waste chemical in the blood can lead to swelling of the body, especially face and feet, vomitings and decreased urine output. Low levels of serum creatinine indicate low muscle mass. A Creatinine blood test will help the doctor to take measures to improve your kidneys’ health.

Even when you are resting, your body is constantly working, and producing energy for the proper working of all parts of the body. Typically, the food we eat is used for this energy production, and the unused or undigested parts are ‘excreted’ out of the body via urine and stool.   Uric acid is the final waste product of purine (a type of protein) metabolism; it is the function of the kidneys to filter it out. A uric acid serum test reflects the uric acid content in your blood. As a result, any deviation from the uric acid normal range can be an indication of various medical conditions like dehydration, kidney disease, heart disease, cancer, etc.

A blood urea and serum creatinine test comprises two different tests to check the function of the kidneys. These two substances, urea and creatinine, are waste products produced as a result of the body's metabolism. Typically, urea and creatinine dissolve in the blood and your kidneys filter them and excrete them out through urine. However, in kidney disease, the levels of both these by-products will increase in the blood, as the kidneys will be unable to filter them. 
Abnormal urea and creatinine levels in the blood are a sign of acute or chronic kidney disease. Your doctor will advise further tests to evaluate for the cause of this and the kind of kidney disease you might be having.

A Vitamin B12 and Folate test is a blood test that measures the levels of two important B vitamins, vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and folate (also known as folic acid or vitamin B9), in one's bloodstream. These vitamins play crucial roles in various bodily functions, and testing their levels can help diagnose deficiencies or assess overall health.

A Vitamin B12 and Folate test is typically recommended for individuals in several specific situations. Firstly, if someone experiences symptoms associated with a deficiency in these vitamins, such as restlessness or neurological issues, their doctor may order these tests to assess their vitamin levels. Secondly, certain populations, including older adults, vegetarians/vegans, individuals with malabsorption conditions, and pregnant women, are at a higher risk of developing deficiencies and may undergo these tests as part of routine health assessments. Additionally, people with chronic medical conditions that can affect nutrient absorption may be monitored regularly for vitamin B12 and folate levels.

Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency typically encompass fatigue, weakness, and neurological issues like numbness or tingling in the extremities, difficulty with balance and walking, and cognitive changes such as memory problems or mood disturbances. Physical signs may include glossitis and jaundice. On the other hand, folate deficiency often shows symptoms like tiredness, anaemia, mouth sores, digestive problems, and mental changes like difficulty concentrating and mood disturbances. During pregnancy, folate deficiency can harm fetal development. As these symptoms can overlap with other conditions, it's essential to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis.

To collect a blood sample for the test, a trained laboratory technician from Apollo 24|7 will come to your doorstep to draw blood from a vein in your arm by inserting a needle. The procedure is quick, simple, and relatively painless when performed by experts at Apollo 24|7.
The Apollo Vitamin B12 and Folate test consists of two tests which include the Vitamin B12 test and the Folic Acid - Serum test. Each test has its specific procedure, which is performed by trained medical professionals in the Apollo 24|7 labs.

If the test shows a deficiency in vitamin B12, one should consult a doctor who shall work to determine the cause. Treatment often involves vitamin B12 supplementation, either in the form of oral supplements or injections, depending on the severity of the deficiency. On the other hand, for folate deficiency, treatment usually involves increasing dietary folate intake and sometimes taking folic acid supplements. Adequate folate levels are especially important during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus. If these deficiencies are caused by malabsorption or an underlying medical condition, those issues also need to be addressed.

To opt for an Apollo Vitamin B12 and Folate test on Apollo 24|7, individuals can book a slot through the website or mobile app. The Apollo Vitamin B12 and Folate test price is competitive with market standards, and the test results are usually available within 24 hours of sample collection.

It is formed by the deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (Bence Jones proteins) in various organs and tissues throughout the body. It is typically a result of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. While it is believed that genetic factors, age, chemical exposure, and immune system issues are potential contributors, the exact cause remains unclear. Their presence in the urine is a diagnostic hallmark of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.

The human body constantly undergoes the process of formation and resorption during which bones are remodeled. Around 90% of a bone's organic matrix comprises Type I collagen. During the bone remodeling process, osteoclast cells release a mixture of neutral and acidic enzymes that break down the collagen into molecules, including C-terminal telopeptide (CTx).
As bones age, the amino acids present in CTx change their chemical composition from Alpha to Beta. When that occurs, the bone remodeling process releases Beta-CTx into the bloodstream, which is indicative of Type I collagen degradation.

If you suffer from high cholesterol levels, you have probably been asked by your doctor or healthcare provider to lower your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. LDL cholesterol is often called “bad” cholesterol since it blocks the blood vessels and increases the chances of having a heart attack or stroke.
To understand the contributors of heart attacks, many doctors prescribe the C-reactive protein test.
C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. Its level rises due to inflammation in the body. The C-reactive protein test measures the levels of C-reactive protein in the blood.

The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. Chickenpox or shingles are usually diagnosed with a visual examination by a healthcare professional. Sometimes, a healthcare provider may order a Varicella IGG test to check for immunity to the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Varicella IGG test may be done on individuals who are at a higher risk of getting complications from VZV and who don't have or are unsure about their immunity, including pregnant women, new born babies, if the mother is infected, people (teens and adults) with symptoms of chickenpox, and those with HIV/AIDS or other conditions that affect immunity. Chickenpox is a common childhood disease that is highly contagious and may cause red, itchy sores throughout the body. Chickenpox is usually a mild illness in healthy children, but it can become serious for people with a weakened immune system, pregnant women, adults, and new born babies.

The Filaria Antigen test is a diagnostic test used to detect the presence of microfilariae infections in individuals. Microfilariae are filarial larvae, thread-like worms found in infected mosquitoes. When infected mosquitoes bite a human they transmit these thread-like worms into the blood causing a parasitic disease called Filariasis. The microfilariae also disrupt the lymphatic system's function thereby causing lymphatic filariasis. The Filaria Antigen test enables healthcare professionals to identify specific antigens produced by filarial worms, allowing for early detection and appropriate treatment of these conditions.

The microfilariae circulate in the body during the night, which is why a blood sample should be taken at that time. This test detects higher anti-filarial antibodies in the blood.

In severe cases, the symptoms of the infection are grossly swollen limbs, pitting of the skin, and swelling in the genitals. Filariasis, if left untreated, can develop into chyluria, hydrocele, lymphedema, and elephantiasis.

A Filaria Antigen test is recommended in the following cases:

It is especially fatal during pregnancy since the parasites might be transmitted through the placenta. The foetus can sustain severe damage before the development of toxoplasma-specific antibodies. However, if this infection is contracted before pregnancy, it poses no threat to the foetus since the maternal antibodies protect it.

Pseudocholinesterase: You can find them in serum, liver, muscle, pancreas, the white matter of the brain, and the heart.
The enzyme plays a vital role in transmitting the nerve impulse by breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. A reduction in the activity of the cholinesterase leads to an excess of acetylcholine in the nerve ending, leading to overstimulation of nerves within the body.

Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting the infection to human beings, however, this is not the only mode of disease transfer. Since blood-to-blood interaction is vital, the virus can also propagate through maternal-fetal transmission and organ transplantation.
This mosquito-borne disease has the potential to convert into an epidemic quite easily as the spread happens when a mosquito feeds on the host/infected person. Since chikungunya virus infection is highly communicable, it’s important to catch the spread at its early stage.

Dengue is a viral disease that is caused by the bite of an Aedes mosquito. It occurs when the virus that causes the disease enters the bloodstream and triggers severe flu-like illness. In extreme cases, one may experience severe dengue, a life-threatening condition. The disease is most prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical climates in the world.
The female Aedes mosquito gets infected after biting a dengue-infected person. After it feeds on it, the virus undergoes replication in the mosquito’s midgut before spreading to the secondary tissues. The period from when the mosquito gets infected to when it infects a new human host is called the extrinsic incubation period.

The white blood cells (WBCs), also known as leukocytes, are essential to the immune system. The cell’s ability to fight against infections depends on the WBC count in the blood. In an adult person, the ideal WBC count should be between 4500 and 11000 per microlitre of blood.
Someone with a high WBC count would have leukocytes of more than 11000 in a microlitre of blood. This condition is known as leukocytosis. It can be of the following types:
Lymphocytic leukocytosis: Lymphocytes are a type of WBC that are a vital part of the immune system. These leukocytes ward off parasites, fungal growth, viruses, and bacteria. However, a high count of these cells is the most common cause of two known types of blood cancers: lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoma.

The CA 72.4 - Cancer Marker Test is a diagnostic assessment that helps detect the presence of colorectal cancer, a form of cancer that begins in gastrointestinal system (colon and rectum). The CA 72.4 cancer marker is a biomarker that is directly linked to this cancer. These organs are a part of your gastrointestinal system.
The colon removes water and some micronutrients and electrolytes from partially digested food. Upon absorption, the waste matter is pushed through the small intestine into the rectum. Finally, the waste is expelled through the anus. This cancer essentially starts with the growth of polyps on the inner lining of your colon or rectum. Over time, these polyps can develop into an all-out colorectal cancer.

Acetylcholinesterase: These are found in RBCs of lungs, spleen, nerve endings, and the brain’s grey matter.
Pseudocholinesterase: You can find them in serum, liver, muscle, pancreas, the white matter of the brain, and the heart.
The enzyme plays a vital role in transmitting the nerve impulse by breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. A reduction in the activity of the cholinesterase leads to an excess of acetylcholine in the nerve ending, leading to overstimulation of nerves within the body.

Iron Saturation is a laboratory test that measures the amount of iron that is bound to transferrin, a protein that carries iron in the blood. It calculates the percentage of iron-binding sites on transferrin that are currently occupied by iron. The Iron Saturation Panel is a comprehensive test that includes other parameters such as serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin levels, which help to evaluate the body's iron status.
Iron is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes such as oxygen transportation, energy production, and DNA synthesis. However, too little or too much iron can lead to several health problems. Low iron saturation levels are associated with iron-deficiency anaemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pale skin. On the other hand, high iron saturation levels can lead to hemochromatosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of excess iron in the body's tissues and organs.
