#Medical Chatbot for Test Recommendation
This project implements a medical chatbot that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning techniques (optional) to assist users in identifying potentially relevant medical tests based on their symptoms. The chatbot is built using a combination of frameworks, including LangChain, LangGraph, Flask, and Selenium.

#Key Features:

Symptom-Based Recommendations: The chatbot gathers information about user symptoms through interactive dialogue.
Medical Test Knowledge Base: The chatbot utilizes a curated knowledge base containing details of various medical tests.
OpenAI API Integration: The chatbot employs OpenAI's GPT-4 language model (or a suitable alternative) to generate informative responses and guide the conversation flow.
Reinforcement Learning (Optional): While not explicitly implemented in your code, you could explore reinforcement learning techniques to incentivize the chatbot to provide accurate and helpful test recommendations.
Data Source:

The project collects data from https://www.apollo247.com/lab-tests to build its understanding of various medical tests.

#Dependencies:

langchain
langgraph
flask
selenium
openai (or suitable alternative)

#Installation:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/anmol900/medical_chatbot.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd medical-chatbot
Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (Create a requirements.txt file listing the dependencies)
Obtain an OpenAI API key (or relevant API key for your chosen language model) and set the AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
#Running the Chatbot:

Replace placeholders (e.g., model="gpt-4-32k") with your desired model and configurations.
Ensure you have internet access for API calls.
Execute the application script: python app.py (Replace app.py with your actual script name)
#Usage:

Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it by providing information about your symptoms.

#Considerations:

This is a research prototype and should not be used for medical diagnosis.
The chatbot's accuracy depends on the quality of the underlying data and models.
Ensure appropriate disclaimers and limitations are included when presenting recommendations.
Consider implementing safety measures to prevent misuse or misinterpretation of the chatbot's output.
Further Development:

Explore incorporating reinforcement learning for enhanced test recommendation accuracy.
Integrate a user interface for a more interactive experience.
Expand the knowledge base with additional medical tests and conditions.
Enhance the chatbot's ability to understand user intent and respond with empathy.
